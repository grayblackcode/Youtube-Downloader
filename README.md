# Youtube Downloader
### Build a script to download videos from YouTube using the PyTube Python library

This is a simple project to get to start applying your Python skill on a real-world problem like downloading your best YouTube videos. The instructions are as simple as this:

***NOTE** that this project requires your openness to learn new skills fast by looking at module documentations and reading blogs, a skill that all developers should possess â€“ all solutions and assistance is available somewhere online. However, do refrain from copying someone's entire project for the sake of completion*

1. Learn about the PyTube Library and understand how you can download YouTube videos by entering a video link on your script. Here is the [link to the PyTube documentation](https://pytube.io/en/latest/api.html#youtube-object)
2. Now create your YouTube downloader and make sure the downloaded file is named after the title of the video automatically
3. [OPTIONAL] Additionally, you can take the challenge a notch higher by creating a minimal graphical user interface with tkinter that allows users to input a link on a visual form and get notified when the download starts and when it is complete. [Learn more tkinter from the official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html).

Once done, feel free to download your videos freely with your script and **say no using SaveFromNet ever again!**
